# Customizing Your Agent

Two surfaces shape how your agent behaves: Markdown files in the workspace (persona,
rules, profile) and environment variables (wiring, budgets, features). This guide covers
both. [`.env.example`](../.env.example) stays the complete variable reference.

## Workspace files

The workspace lives at `<state root>/workspace/` (default `~/.swift-claw/workspace/`).
Create any of these files and the daemon loads them on the next turn; a missing file is
skipped.

| File | What it shapes | Trust tier |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Personality and tone. The place to say "answer tersely", "be playful", "reply in Russian". | System prompt |
| `AGENTS.md` | Behavior rules: how to act, what to prioritize, standing instructions. | System prompt |
| `TOOLS.md` | Guidance on when and how to use tools. | System prompt |
| `USER.md` | Your profile: who you are, context the agent should know. | Untrusted, labeled |
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-lived memory the agent maintains. | Untrusted, labeled |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | A checklist the proactive heartbeat reads, never ordinary turns. | Heartbeat runs only |

The trust tier decides how much authority the text carries:

- **`SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `TOOLS.md` join the system prompt.** You write them, and
  the model treats them as trusted instruction. They also feed the policy fingerprint, so
  editing one invalidates any approval still waiting on the old prompt. Nothing you put in
  them can loosen the security policy, which lives in code rather than in the prompt.
- **`USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` enter inside an untrusted, labeled wrapper**, below the
  system prompt, so text that reached them through poisoned memory cannot claim system
  authority. Both count as private data for the exfiltration gate below.

When the agent writes to `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, or `MEMORY.md`, the approval
card carries a privileged-file banner. `TOOLS.md` does not get one.

The agent writes and reads dated daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) when a turn calls for
one; the context builder never injects them the way it injects the files above.

Durable facts also live in the database: confirm something in chat ("remember that ...")
and it persists in SQLite with full-text recall across restarts. `/memory` shows what is
stored.

## When the agent asks permission

Two mechanisms produce an approval card. They answer different questions.

**The tool's own risk tier.** File writes, memory writes, and code execution park the run
every time, whatever else the session did.

**Exfiltration risk.** clawd holds a fetch to an arbitrary URL for your approval once the
session has done *both* of these:

- **Ingested untrusted content.** A web page, a file read, tool output, or a voice
  transcript. Durable memory does not count: it is labeled untrusted but does not taint
  the session on its own.
- **Touched private data.** Assembling `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, or stored memory items into
  the context is enough; no tool has to read them. Once you have filled in `USER.md`, this
  leg is armed on essentially every turn, and it sticks for the session.

One leg alone does not trigger the gate, so the first `web_fetch` of a clean session runs
unprompted. `/new` clears both legs.

Your LLM provider and the search backend are pinned endpoints and never park for approval.
clawd defends them by pinning the destination rather than by asking: it cannot be aimed at
an attacker's URL. It also scans outbound *tool* arguments for secret-shaped values, and,
under the trifecta, for substrings of your private files. The prompt sent to your LLM
carries `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` verbatim by design, so treat your model provider as a
party you trust with that content.

## Model routing

`CLAW_LLM_MODEL` selects the provider route:

- **A plain model id** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-4o`, `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4`) uses
  the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions route against `CLAW_LLM_BASE_URL` with
  `CLAW_LLM_API_KEY`. This is the supported default and works with local servers too
  (leave the key blank for no-auth endpoints).
- **`openai-chatgpt/<model>`** uses the ChatGPT subscription route. `clawd auth login`
  handles the OAuth flow and prints the exact value to set; base URL and API key are
  unused there.

Related knobs: `CLAW_LLM_STREAMING` (rich streamed drafts, on by default),
`CLAW_LLM_MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAW_LLM_MAX_TOKENS_FIELD`, `CLAW_LLM_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT`.

## Spending limits

All optional; unset means the built-in defaults.

| Variable | Controls |
|---|---|
| `CLAW_PER_RUN_USD` | Cap per single run |
| `CLAW_PER_DAY_USD` | Daily kill-switch across everything |
| `CLAW_PROACTIVE_PER_DAY_USD` | Nested daily cap for scheduled + heartbeat runs (default 2.00) |
| `CLAW_MAX_TURNS` / `CLAW_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` | Bounds on the agentic loop per run |

## Proactive behavior

You create schedules in chat, and you confirm each one before it arms. The environment
sets the frame: `CLAW_TIMEZONE` (IANA zone for schedule defaults and day boundaries),
`CLAW_SCHED_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, `CLAW_SCHED_CATCHUP_MAX_AGE_MINUTES`.

The heartbeat is off by default. `CLAW_HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=true` turns it on (requires
exactly one allowlisted owner), then it works through `HEARTBEAT.md` up to
`CLAW_HEARTBEAT_MAX_PER_DAY` times a day, every `CLAW_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
minutes, staying silent during `CLAW_HEARTBEAT_QUIET_HOURS` (default `22:00-09:00`).

## Voice messages (macOS 26)

On by default, on-device, off on other platforms. `CLAW_VOICE_LOCALES` takes a
comma-separated priority list (`ru-RU,en-US`); there is no audio language detection, so
every configured locale transcribes the note and the most confident transcript wins.
The first use of a locale downloads its speech model.

## Code execution sandbox (macOS 26 arm64)

Off by default. `CLAW_EXEC_ENABLED=true` lets the agent run code in a fresh disposable
VM per request, behind an exact-action approval. Resource limits
(`CLAW_EXEC_MEMORY_MIB`, `CLAW_EXEC_CPUS`, `CLAW_EXEC_TIMEOUT`), the digest-pinned
workload image, and the network opt-in (`CLAW_EXEC_ALLOW_EGRESS`) are documented in
[`.env.example`](../.env.example) and [LOCAL_DEV.md](LOCAL_DEV.md).

## Everything else

- `CLAW_ALLOWLIST`: who may talk to the bot (comma-separated numeric Telegram IDs).
- `CLAW_APPROVAL_EXPIRY`: seconds before a pending approval auto-denies (default 3600).
- `CLAW_SEARCH_API_KEY`: Exa key; unset means the `web_search` tool is absent.
- `CLAW_WEBFETCH_EXEMPT_CIDRS`: SSRF-blocklist exemptions for fake-IP VPN pools.
- `CLAW_LOG_LEVEL`: `trace`, `debug`, `info` (default), `notice`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`.
- `CLAW_STATE_ROOT`: where all of it lives (default `~/.swift-claw`).
